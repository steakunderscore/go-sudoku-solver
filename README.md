# Go Sudoku Solver

This is my first attempt at writing something in Go. While the algorithm only
works sometimes, I'll fix that later.

I'm sure there's better ways to do a lot of things in here, but it's a start.

## Running

There's make tasks, so you can use them:

build:

```
make build
```

test:

```
make test
```

run:

```
make run
```
